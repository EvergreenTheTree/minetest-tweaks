As of 2024-08-17, this mod will probably not be updated by me as I lost interest
in Minetest a long time ago and probably will probably not be coming back.

Description:
This mod applies a few additions and upgrades to minetest_game.

List of Additions:

- Logs(jungle and regular) have 6d facedir
- Swords have better wield scale
- A bedrock layer now stops the player from digging below -1000

Settings (found in settings.txt):
BEDROCK_HEIGHT = -1000.0 (changes how deep the bedrock layer is)
WIELD_X = 1.5
WIELD_Y = 1.8  (these change the wield scale of the sword)
WIELD_Z = 0.7
